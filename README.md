# Computer Organization & Architecture

This repository contains all my notes on the subject `COA`

## Introduction

- It is a combination of `computer architecture` and `computer organization`

- `Computer architecture` explains the internal design of computers such as:

    1. Instruction

    2. Addressing modes

    3. ALU

    4. Pipeline

- Whereas `computer organization` explains how the features are implemented i.e.
*memory and I/O management*

  - That is, how various memories and I/O devices interact w/ the system

*Note*: [*Commit tags*](<https://bit.ly/commit-tags>)
