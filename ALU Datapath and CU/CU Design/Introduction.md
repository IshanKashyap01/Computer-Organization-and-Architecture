# Control Unit Design

- CU is the supervisor of the system as it controls all activities

- It generates control signals and activates the interrupt service

- These control signals are required to execute the micro-operations

- These signals are directly executed on the hardware

## Control Unit Implementation

### Hardwired CU Design

- Control signals are written in **Sum of Product (SOP)** expressions

- It uses a fix set of logic gates and circuits to execute instructions

- The control signals are hardwired into the `CU`, so it has a dedicated circuit
for every possible instruction

- They're the *fastest* but more *rigid* as even a minor modification *requires*
*rewiring*

- For ex. **Reduced Instruction Set Computer** (RISC)

### Microprogrammed CU Design

- It uses a set of instructions that can be modified or updated

- These instructions are known as `micro code` or `micro instructions`

- The control signals are generated by a *microprograms* stored in memory
