# Micro Programs

The micro-operations performed in a sub-cycle are collectively called a
`micro program`

## Rules for Micro Programs

- Proper sequence of micro-instructions must be followed

- Conflicts must be avoided by not reading and writing to the same register at
the same time

- That is, a register cannot be involved in more than one micro-operation of a
cycle
