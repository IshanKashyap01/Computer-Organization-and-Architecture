# Instruction Set Architecture

- The ISA is the interface b/w the s/w and h/w of a computer system

- It abstracts the microarchitecture (internal design and implementation of the
system) from the s/w

- It has the following components

    1. `Instruction Set`

    2. `Instruction Encoding`

    3. `Data Types`

    4. `Registers`

    5. `Addressing Modes`

    6. `Control Flow`
