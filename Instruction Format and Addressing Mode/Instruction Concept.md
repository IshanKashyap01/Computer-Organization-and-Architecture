# Concept of Instruction

- An instruction is a basic unit of operation executed by a CPU

- They are encoded in binary, which the CPU reads and executes according to the
*Instruction Set Architecture* (ISA)

- `Operation`: Specific task that CPU performs such as arithmetic/logical, data
movement, control flow or I/O

- `ISA`: Set of all instructions that the CPU supports as well as their format
and encoding

- `Encoding`: The CPU's *instruction decoder* interprets binary patterns

- `Instruction Format`: Specifies different fields of opcode, registers, memory
addresses, intermediate values and control bits
