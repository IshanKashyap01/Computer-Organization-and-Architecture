# CPU

- `ALU`: *Arithmetic Logical Unit* performs arithmetical and logical operations
on data such as $+, -, \times, \div$, AND, OR and NOT

- `CU`: *Control Unit* directs all the operations (and other components) of the CPU

- `MMU`: *Memory Management Unit* handles memory-related operations such as translation,
protection and access permissions

- `Clock Generator`: generates clock signals to synchronize operations and ensure
correct sequence of execution

- `BIU`: *Bus Interface Unit* manages communication b/w CPU and other h/w devices

- `Registers`: small high speed storage within the CPU used to store temp data
during instruction execution
