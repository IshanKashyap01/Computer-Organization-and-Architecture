# Memory

## Primary Memory

- `RAM`: volatile memory that serves as a temporary storage to hold data and
instructions that the CPU is actively processing

### Cache Memory

- Small high speed memory unit located close or within the CPU

- `L1 Cache`: located within the CPU, it is the fastest but smallest cache

- `L2 Cache`: located outside the CPU but within the same chip, larger but slower
than L1

- `L3 Cache`: located further away from the CPU, largest but slowest of the three
caches

## Secondary Memory

- Stores data persistently and used to store the user's data and various applications

- However, secondary memory is slower than primary memory

- `HDD` uses spinning magnetic disks to store large amounts of data

- `SSD` uses flash memory to store data is much faster than HDDs

- `Optical Drives` uses LASER technology to read and write data such as CDs, DVDs,
and Blu-rays

- `Flash Drives` portable devices such as USBs and thumb drives that uses flash
memory to store data

## Other Types of Memories

- `ROM` stores firmware or boot programs essential for startup

- `EEPROM` *Electrically Erasable & Programmable ROM* used for storing BIOS and
firmware updates
