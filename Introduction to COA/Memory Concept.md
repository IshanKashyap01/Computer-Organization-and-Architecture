# Memory Concept

- Memory is divided into cells and represented in the form $2^n \times m$

  - $n$: number of *address line*

  - $m$: number of *data line*

- *Address line* is the *capacity of the memory* whereas *Data line* is the
*capacity of data (cell size)*

- For ex. 1 KB memory is represented with 10 bit address line and 8 bit data
line
